## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.
